# fermitools-data
Fermitools external data files

Repository for storing the external data files for the fermitools.

Cloning/downloading this repository will NOT include the Interstellar Emission Model (IEM) file due to its large size.  It can be obtained from either the LAT Background Model page (https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/ssc/data/access/lat/BackgroundModels.html) or by installing the Fermitools via conda.
