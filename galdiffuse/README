The IEM is the same as the one in v5r0 and is symlinked from that directory.

The isotropic files are for the P305 dataset.  Information about the derivation can be found at

The event types and event classes are encoded in the filename.

These files are updated versions of the v5r1 files.  They include taking into account the sky
dependence of the PSF and the difference in zenith angle cut between data and model.
